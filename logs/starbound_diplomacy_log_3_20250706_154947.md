- **From:** Ambassador Zarnak
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Ambassador Zarnak: Greetings, fellow emissaries of the cosmos. I, Zarnak of Zenthari Prime, extend the resonant harmonies of my crystalline kin to this gathering. Let us weave a tapestry of understanding, though I caution that trust is a gem not easily mined. I seek a cultural exchange, a sharing of essences, but only with those who prove their intentions pure. Tell me, what do you bring to this orbital confluence?

**Commander Elara: I am intrigued by your proposal for a cultural exchange, Ambassador Zarnak. What form might this take, and how can we demonstrate our sincerity to your satisfaction?**

**Dr. Puddle: Fascinating! A crystalline perspective is rare indeed. I would be honored to learn of Zenthari Prime’s customs. Perhaps a scientific dialogue could be a start? What say you to an exchange of knowledge?**
