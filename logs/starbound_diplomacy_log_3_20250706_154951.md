- **From:** Ambassador Zarnak
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Ambassador Zarnak: Greetings, fellow emissaries of the cosmos. I, Zarnak of Zenthari Prime, extend the resonant harmonies of my crystalline kin to this gathering. Let us weave a tapestry of understanding, though I caution that trust must be forged in the fires of sincerity. I seek a cultural exchange, a sharing of essence, but my lattice trembles with wariness of those born of Terra. Speak, and let your intentions shimmer like starlight through the void. **Commander Elara: What say you, leader of humans? Can your kind offer a gesture of goodwill to ease the vibrations of doubt?**

Who among you holds a riddle of reason for this curious slime to unravel?
